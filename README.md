# Carvana Masking Challenge

The challenge is to develop an algorithm that automatically removes the photo studio background. This will allow Carvana to superimpose cars on a variety of backgrounds. The dataset consists of photos, covering different vehicles with a wide variety of year, make, and model combinations.
